  Q: Why is it not a good idea for an identifier to contain more than
  one adjacent underscore (as in current__balance, for example)?

  A: Identifiers with more than one adjacent underscores can easily
     be typed incorrectly and make finding compile errors due to
     mistyped identifiers hard to find.
